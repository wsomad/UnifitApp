# Unifit Mobile Application

A Final Year Project (FYP) that was fully developed by me.
It is developed by using Flutter with the integration of Firebase as the backend.
The main objective of this FYP project is to help university students in Malaysia to overcome obesity problem through physical activities.
In order to make the process of battling obesity to be more interesting, challenging and creating a healthy competition, three gamification elements have been implemented. 

Those gamification elements are:

1. Progress bar
2. Badges
3. Leaderboard

## Getting Started

This project is my very first project that was fully developed by myself. Even though I'm not really a good programmer but I do believe if I keep pushing myself, I can be a great Software Engineer in the future. Insya Allah.

During the development of this project, I was very thankful to be surrounded with supportive people: friends, lecturers, parents, family and loved one. Until today, I am still feel grateful to have them in my life. Without them, I may not be able to finish this project.
